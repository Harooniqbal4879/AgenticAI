The traceback indicates the error is still happening when processing the return value of the `query_handler_agent`. Looking closely at the `add_conditional_edges` definition, the `lambda state: state` is incorrect for the condition. It should be accessing the key returned by the `query_handler_agent` that determines the next state, which I've now set to be `\"next\"`. I need to correct the lambda function in `add_conditional_edges` to access `state[\"next\"]`. Then I will re-compile the graph and run it with the sample query again.\n",

        "The error persists, indicating that the `query_handler_agent` is still not returning a dictionary in a way that LangGraph expects for conditional edges, even though the code appears to be returning `{\"next\": \"...\"}`. This might be related to how LangGraph's `StateGraph` handles state updates and transitions, particularly with the conditional edges. The `query_handler_agent` is intended *only* to determine the next node, not update the main state with general information. LangGraph's conditional edges work by the node returning a string corresponding to the next node name, not a dictionary. The previous fix was based on a misunderstanding of how conditional edges use the node's return value. The `query_handler_agent` should return the string of the next node name directly. I need to revert the `query_handler_agent` to return just the string name of the next node and keep the `add_conditional_edges` lambda function accessing `state[\"next\"]`. This is confusing, but the error message strongly suggests the *return value* of the node itself is the issue, not just how the conditional edge reads the state. Let's try returning the string again, but re-examine the conditional edge logic if that doesn't work.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's try returning the string name of the next node from the `query_handler_agent` and see if that resolves the error. I will also keep the conditional edge logic as it was in the first attempt, which uses `lambda state: state`. This was the original setup before the error occurred, and the error message specifically pointed to the return value of the node.\n",

        "**Reasoning**:\n",
        "The previous attempt to run the graph failed with an `InvalidUpdateError`. The error message indicates that the `query_handler_agent` is returning a `GraphState` object when a dictionary or string (depending on the edge type) is expected. The `query_handler_agent` function as defined currently returns a string which is correct for the conditional edge. The issue might be in how LangGraph handles the initial state passed to `app.invoke` and the subsequent processing within the graph's first node. Let's explicitly return a dictionary from `query_handler_agent` that updates the state with the determined next node and then use a regular edge from `query_handler` to a new routing node, or re-examine the conditional edge logic to ensure it's correctly interpreting the string output as the next node name.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's re-examine the conditional edge definition and the `query_handler_agent`. The `query_handler_agent` returns a string which is the name of the next node. The `add_conditional_edges` function is designed to use this string return value to determine the next step. The lambda `lambda x: x` is correct for this purpose as it simply passes the output of the `query_handler_agent` as the key for the conditional routing dictionary. The error message \"Expected dict, got GraphState(...)\" suggests the error might be occurring *after* the conditional edge has determined the next node, specifically when the state is being updated by the subsequent node. However, the traceback points to the `_assemble_writes` function within LangGraph's internal state handling, which is triggered by the return value of a node.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's carefully review the `query_handler_agent` function again. It does not modify the state and correctly returns a string. The issue might be with how the initial state is being handled when the graph starts. The `app.invoke` function takes the initial state. LangGraph might be trying to process this initial state as an update from the first node before even calling the first node.\n",
        "\n",
        "A common pattern in LangGraph is for the first node to receive the initial state and then return a dictionary to update the state for the next step. However, the `query_handler_agent`'s purpose is purely routing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's try a slight modification to the `query_handler_agent` to ensure it explicitly returns a dictionary, even if that dictionary only contains information about the next step, which can then be used by a subsequent node or a different type of edge. This deviates from the standard conditional edge pattern but might help isolate the source of the `InvalidUpdateError`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alternatively, the error might be related to how the `GraphState` class is defined or initialized. Let's ensure the `GraphState` class is correctly defined and that its attributes are initialized properly (which they appear to be).\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's try to simplify the graph execution and the `query_handler_agent` return value to see if we can pinpoint the issue. We will modify the `query_handler_agent` to return a dictionary that indicates the chosen route, and then use a regular edge to a separate routing logic node if necessary, or see if returning a dictionary directly from the first node resolves the `InvalidUpdateError`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the traceback points to the state update mechanism (`_assemble_writes`), it's highly likely that the issue is with the return type of the node function not being a dictionary as expected by the state update logic in certain scenarios, even when using conditional edges. Although the documentation suggests a string return is valid for conditional edges, there might be an interaction with the initial state or other graph configurations causing this error.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's modify the `query_handler_agent` to return a dictionary containing the determined next node name under a specific key, say `'next_node'`, and then adjust the conditional edge to read this key from the dictionary. This ensures the node always returns a dictionary, which is the standard way nodes update the state.\n",

The `InvalidUpdateError` from before might have been related to how the initial state was being processed, or a subtle interaction within LangGraph.

The traceback indicates the error is happening during the state update process, specifically in `_assemble_writes` within LangGraph's pregel execution. This is happening at the `__start__` task, which suggests the very first step of processing the initial state is causing the issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "This error usually means that a node returned something other than a dictionary when it was expected to return a dictionary to update the state. In this case, the `query_handler_agent` returns a string, which *should* be handled by the conditional edge logic for routing and not directly used to update the state. However, the error message explicitly says it got a `GraphState` object, not a string. This is very strange, as the `query_handler_agent`'s code clearly returns a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "This might indicate a misunderstanding of how LangGraph handles the initial state when it's a custom object like `GraphState` and how it interacts with the first node's return value. It's possible that when the graph starts, it implicitly tries to use the initial `GraphState` object to perform an 'update' before the first node's output is processed by the conditional edge, leading to this error because a `GraphState` object is not a dictionary of updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's try initializing the graph with a dictionary containing the query instead of a `GraphState` object. LangGraph often works more seamlessly when the state is managed as a dictionary internally, and the custom `GraphState` class is used to define the schema and potentially add methods. By initializing with a dictionary, we ensure the initial state is in the expected format for state updates. The `GraphState` class can still be used within the nodes for type hinting and easier attribute access (LangGraph can often work with attribute access on dictionary-based states if the schema is defined).\n",
        "\n",
        "We will modify the invocation part to pass a dictionary `{ \"query\": sample_query }` instead of `GraphState(query=sample_query)`.

        "**Reasoning**:\n",
        "The error message has changed slightly, now saying `Expected dict, got content_strategist` and the traceback points to the `query_handler` task. This confirms that the `query_handler_agent` is correctly returning the string \"content_strategist\", but LangGraph's state update mechanism is trying to interpret this string as a state update dictionary, which is incorrect for how conditional edges are supposed to work based on the node's return value.\n",
        "\n",
        "This behavior is unexpected based on the standard usage of `add_conditional_edges` where the node's return value is a string representing the next node name. It suggests there might be a specific requirement or nuance when using a custom `GraphState` class or with the specific version of LangGraph being used in this environment that is causing this conflict.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since directly returning the string for conditional routing is causing an `InvalidUpdateError` by being misinterpreted as a state update, and returning a dictionary for routing caused an `AttributeError`, we need a different approach to handle the initial routing based on the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "A robust way to handle initial routing when the standard conditional edge on the entry node is problematic is to introduce a dedicated \"router\" node immediately after the entry point. The entry point node will receive the initial state (either `GraphState` or a dictionary), potentially perform some initial processing if needed (though not necessary for just routing), and return the full state (or a dictionary representing the state). A subsequent \"router\" node will then receive this state, determine the next step based on the query, and return a string representing the next node name. The conditional edge will then be on this \"router\" node.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's add a simple `initial_processing_node` as the entry point that just passes the state along, and a `router_node` that replicates the logic of the original `query_handler_agent` but is not the entry point. The conditional edge will be from this `router_node`.\n",

        "The traceback shows an `AttributeError: 'GraphState' object has no attribute 'get'` occurring in the `router_node`. This means that even though we are initializing the graph with a dictionary `{\"query\": sample_query}`, the state object being passed to the `router_node` is still a `GraphState` object, not a dictionary. This is surprising, as the `initial_processing_node` was designed to return a dictionary representation of the state.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `GraphState` class is defined with attributes like `query`, `research_data`, etc. When LangGraph uses a custom state class with `StateGraph`, it manages an instance of this class. The nodes receive and can modify this instance. When a node returns a dictionary, LangGraph uses that dictionary to update the attributes of the `GraphState` instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `AttributeError` in `router_node` indicates that `state` within that function is the `GraphState` object. The previous attempt to convert `GraphState` to a dictionary in `initial_processing_node` seems not to have resulted in a dictionary being passed to the `router_node`. This might be due to how LangGraph's state management merges updates back into the `GraphState` instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most reliable way for nodes to interact with the state when using a custom `GraphState` is to access and modify its attributes directly, rather than treating it as a dictionary. The `router_node` should access the query using `state.query` instead of `state.get(\"query\")`. Similarly, other agents like `deep_research_agent`, `seo_blog_writer_agent`, etc., should also access state using attribute access (`state.query`, `state.research_data`, etc.) and return dictionaries to update the state. All agent functions are already doing this correctly, except for the `router_node` which was modified in the last step.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's revert the `router_node` to access the query using `state.query`. The `initial_processing_node` might still be useful to ensure the initial dictionary input correctly populates the `GraphState` instance's attributes, although it might not need to return a dictionary itself if LangGraph handles the initial state mapping automatically. Let's keep the `initial_processing_node` as is for now, as it correctly handles both dictionary and `GraphState` inputs, and focus on fixing the `router_node`.\n",

        "The `InvalidUpdateError: Expected dict, got GraphState(...)` is still occurring at the `__start__` task, even when invoking the graph with a pre-initialized `GraphState` object. The error message and traceback are identical to the first time we encountered this error. This strongly suggests that the issue is with how LangGraph's `StateGraph` specifically handles the *very first* step of processing the initial state when a custom state class is used. It seems to be trying to perform a state update using the initial `GraphState` object itself, which it expects to be a dictionary of updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `initial_processing_node` was intended to be the entry point and handle the initial state, but the error is happening *before* the code inside `initial_processing_node` even executes. This is evident from the traceback pointing to the `__start__` task and the state update logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given this persistent error at the graph's entry point with a custom `GraphState`, the most likely solution is to redefine the state of the `StateGraph` to be a simple dictionary (`dict`) instead of our custom `GraphState` class. LangGraph's dictionary-based state management is more fundamental and less likely to have issues with the initial state processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can still conceptually use the attributes defined in `GraphState` (query, research_data, etc.) as keys in the dictionary state. The agent functions will need to be slightly modified to access state using dictionary key access (`state.get(\"query\")` or `state[\"query\"]`) instead of attribute access (`state.query`). Returning dictionaries from agents to update the state is already the correct pattern for dictionary-based state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's redefine the `StateGraph` to use `dict` for its state. We will also update all agent functions to use dictionary access for state variables. The graph structure with `initial_processing` -> `router` and the conditional edge on `router` should still work, but we might be able to simplify and remove the `initial_processing_node` if the router can now be the entry point and correctly handle the initial dictionary input.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's try making the `router_node` the entry point again and define the `StateGraph` with `dict` as the state type. We will update the `router_node` and all other agent nodes to use dictionary access.\n",

        "**Reasoning**:\n",
        "We've successfully resolved the initial `InvalidUpdateError` by switching to a dictionary-based state. The graph now starts, and the `router_node` executes correctly, returning the string \"deep_research\". The conditional edge then correctly routes to the `deep_research_agent`. However, a new error occurs within the `deep_research_agent`: `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'`. The traceback shows this happens on the line `query = state.get(\"query\")`. This means that the `state` object being passed to the `deep_research_agent` is not the full dictionary state as expected, but rather the *string output* from the previous node (`router_node`), which was \"deep_research\". This reveals another crucial aspect of LangGraph's `StateGraph` with dictionary state: the return value of a node is used to update the state *for the next node*, but the next node receives the *entire, updated state*, not just the output of the previous node. In our case, the `router_node` returns a string (\"deep_research\"). This string is used by the conditional edge for routing, but it is *also* being used to update the state before passing it to `deep_research_agent`. Since the return value is not a dictionary, LangGraph seems to be replacing the entire state with this string, leading to the `deep_research_agent` receiving a string instead of the expected state dictionary. To fix this, the `router_node` should return a dictionary that updates the state *without* overwriting the entire state with the routing string. The routing decision should still be based on the router's output, but the output itself needs to be a dictionary. We can modify the `router_node` to return a dictionary like `{\"route\": next_node}`. Then, the conditional edge needs to be updated to read this `'route'` key from the state *after* the `router_node` has updated it. Let's redefine the `router_node` to return a dictionary containing the next node name under a key, and update the conditional edge to use this key for routing. The state is now a dictionary, so `state.get(\"route\")` in the conditional edge lambda is appropriate.\n",

The subtask requires ensuring these keys are available and retrying the graph execution. While the notebook history shows attempts to load from `.env`, the execution logs indicate the keys were not found. Directly setting `os.environ` with dummy keys (as actual keys cannot be provided in this environment) within the code block will allow the agents to proceed past the API key check, even if the external API calls will still fail with authentication errors. This will at least allow us to test the workflow's structure and agent interaction flow without the immediate `KeyError` or `None` value issues within the agents. We will then re-compile and run the graph using the dictionary state and the router node, as this configuration successfully bypassed the `InvalidUpdateError` in the previous step.\n",

        "The workflow execution proceeded past the router node and into the agents, confirming the state management and routing structure are working. However, the `deep_research_agent` reported \"No query provided for research\", indicating the state wasn't correctly passed or accessed. Additionally, the `content_strategist_agent` failed with an `AttributeError` related to accessing `openai.ChatCompletion`, which indicates an incompatibility with the installed OpenAI library version (`openai>=1.0.0`). The next step is to address the state access issue in the agents and update the OpenAI API calls in all relevant agents (`seo_blog_writer_agent`, `linkedin_post_writer_agent`, `image_generation_agent`, `content_strategist_agent`) to use the new API syntax (`openai.chat.completions.create`, `openai.images.generate`).

        "**Reasoning**:\n",
        "The deep research agent is still reporting \"No query provided for research\", indicating an issue with how the state is being passed or updated between the router and the deep research agent. The router returns `{\"route\": \"deep_research\"}`, which updates the state. However, the `query` key from the initial input `{\"query\": sample_query}` is not being preserved or merged correctly in the state that the `deep_research_agent` receives. Additionally, the workflow seems to be jumping directly from `deep_research` to `content_strategist` without the state from `deep_research` being fully available, as seen in the final state. LangGraph's `StateGraph` with a dictionary state is designed to merge updates. The `router_node` returning `{\"route\": next_node}` correctly updates the state with the `route` key. When the edge from `router` leads to `deep_research`, the `deep_research_agent` should receive the full state dictionary, including the original `query`. The error \"No query provided\" suggests this isn't happening as expected, or there's an issue with how the state is returned from `deep_research_agent`. The `deep_research_agent` should return the *entire* updated state dictionary, not just the `research_data`. Let's ensure all agent functions explicitly return the `state` dictionary after making updates to guarantee state propagation. We will also explicitly add `return state` at the end of each agent function to make the state propagation clear.\n",

        "**Reasoning**:\n",
        "The workflow is still failing because the `deep_research_agent` is not receiving the query, and the state is not being correctly propagated. The issue is likely that the initial state dictionary `{\"query\": sample_query}` is *not* being merged into the state before the router node's return value updates the state. The router node receives the initial dictionary, adds the 'route' key, and returns `{'route': 'deep_research'}`. LangGraph's StateGraph with a dictionary state should merge updates, but it seems the initial dictionary input isn't being fully integrated into the state before the *first* node's return. A potential fix is to explicitly initialize the state with the query *within* the router node before determining the route. This ensures the query is always present in the state that is updated and passed to subsequent nodes. We will modify the `router_node` to explicitly include the initial query in its return dictionary, ensuring the query is part of the state passed to the next node. We will then re-compile and re-run.\n",
